# Loka Antifragile TPM Playbook – Benefiting from Mistakes

**Principle:** Small failures should strengthen the system. Local errors become global learning.

## Practices
- Run deliberate “micro-failures” (tiny scope experiments) to test feasibility before committing.
- Treat post-mortems as reusable stress-test cases for future TPMs (documented in the lessons repo).
- Rotate TPMs through high-uncertainty projects to build antifragile skill via exposure.
- Encourage “red teaming” of project assumptions early (let engineers and TPMs try to break the plan).
- Build feedback loops where every client escalation strengthens the playbook for the next project.

## Loka Example
**Mistake**: A client demo crashed due to unexpected API throttling. 
**Solution**: The fix became a regression test and part of the kickoff checklist for future AI projects.
**Antifragile action**: fail small and make sure the solution and lessons learned are spread system-wide and organization-wide, following Nassim Taleb's quote - "what 
kills me, makes others stronger".
