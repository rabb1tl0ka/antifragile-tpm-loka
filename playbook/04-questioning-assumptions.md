# Loka Antifragile TPM Playbook – Questioning Assumptions

**Principle:** Hunt for absolute assumptions and stress-test them. One counterexample can break the system.

## Practices
- Reframe absolutes into falsifiable questions (“all data is accurate” → “is at least one critical field wrong?”).
- Challenge “client clarity” as an assumption—business goals always shift mid-project.
- Treat “more planning = fewer surprises” as suspect; rigid plans collapse fastest.
- Document assumptions at kickoff and assign owners to verify/disprove them during delivery.
- Build assumption reviews into retros and mid-project checkpoints.

## Loka Example
**Assumption**: “All client stakeholders agree on success criteria.” 
**Counterexample**: One sponsor expected time-to-market, another prioritized compliance. Kickoff alignment workshop exposed this before work began.
**Antifragile action**: treat assumptions as hypotheses, not truths.
