# Loka Antifragile TPM Playbook – Via Negativa

**Principle:** Avoid harm first. Strength often comes from subtraction — removing fragility, complexity, or noise — rather than adding more layers of control.

## Practices
- Remove redundant tools and dashboards; one clear signal beats five noisy ones.
- Eliminate unnecessary meetings; async updates or fewer touchpoints reduce fatigue and bottlenecks.
- Strip pilots to the **single critical feature** instead of overloading with extras.
- Kill risky dependencies early (e.g., unstable APIs, flaky contractors) instead of hoping they’ll stabilize later.
- Default to subtraction: when under stress, ask *“What can we safely remove?”* before asking *“What should we add?”*.

## Loka Examples
### Reporting Overload
A biotech project was falling behind. Leadership pushed for more Jira dashboards, BI reports and extra standups.
- Fragile outcome: engineers lost focus, TPMs spent hours curating dashboards, project slowed further.
- **Via Negativa action:** removed all but one trusted progress metric (weekly milestone burndown). This reduced the "noise" and increased focus.

### Pilot Feature Creep
A client insisted on “as many features as possible” in a first pilot.
- Fragile outcome: bugs multiplied, compliance risk increased, delivery slowed.
- **Via Negativa action:** pilot launched with only the critical path feature. It proved value quickly and avoided wasted effort on non-essentials.
