# Loka Antifragile TPM Playbook – Optionality

**Principle:** True optionality means holding several small-cost alternatives open where the downside is limited but the upside is uncapped. You don’t need to predict 
the future correctly — you just need exposure to multiple paths to increase your survival chances.

## Practices
- Develop lightweight parallel prototypes (e.g., compliance-ready vs. fast prototype) until external uncertainty resolves.
- Maintain at least two technical approaches (e.g., cloud-native vs. on-prem) when client needs or regulations are unclear.
- Use phased launches (pilot cohorts, feature flags) instead of big-bang delivery; one path may succeed while another fails without sinking the whole project.
- Keep multiple go-to-market channels (direct sales, partnerships, open-source/community) alive until the strongest signal emerges.
- Treat optionality as asymmetric bets: small extra cost → outsized resilience and opportunity.

## Loka Examples
### Biotech Client
Regulatory classification of an AI analytics tool was uncertain.
- **Option A**: unregulated analytics dashboard, fast ROI.
- **Option B**: compliance-ready decision-support tool, slower but sustainable.
When regulators clarified, Loka scaled the winning option without restarting.
**Antifragile action**: parallel prototypes preserve upside while capping the downside.

### Infrastructure
Instead of one cloud region, Loka deployed pilots in two regions (US-East and EU-West).
- Downside: small extra cost.
- Upside: resilience against outages + ability to meet client data residency requirements.
**Antifragile action**: dual-region setup turned fragility into a sales advantage.
