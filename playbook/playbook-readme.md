# Loka Antifragile TPM Playbook

This playbook adapts Nassim Taleb’s *Antifragile* principles to Technical Project Management at **Loka**.
Its goal is to help TPMs deliver projects that **avoid fragility, survive stress and grow stronger from mistakes.**

   *Use small errors as stress-tests that harden the system.*

4. [Questioning Assumptions – Stress-Test Absolutes](04-questioning-assumptions.md)
   *Reframe hidden assumptions into falsifiable hypotheses.*

5. [Fragility Assessment – Mapping Vectors & Ruin Exposure](05-fragility-assessment.md)

## How to Use This Playbook
- At **kickoff**: run a fragility assessment and question assumptions.
- During **delivery**: apply via negativa and optionality to prevent over-commitment.
- After **incidents**: document mistakes and feed them back into the playbook.
- As a **team habit**: challenge absolutes, design for redundancy and rotate TPMs through uncertainty.

## Loka Context
Loka projects often involve **AI, biotech and high-uncertainty innovation**.
These domains live in *Extremistan*—rare events dominate outcomes.
This playbook ensures TPMs aren’t just avoiding failure, but actually **benefiting from volatility.**
