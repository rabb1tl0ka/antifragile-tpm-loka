Lesson: Do not assume client data is clean. Summary: We assumed clientâ€™s CSV exports were reliable. Midway, we found missing IDs and duplicate rows, forcing rework of our entire pipeline.. Context: phase=Build, client=Biotech Co., industries=Biotech, type=MVP. What happened: Initial integration showed data gaps and duplicates that broke workflows.. Root cause: No upfront validation of client data quality.. (category: Data Quality) Impact: level=4, Delivery delayed by 3 weeks to rebuild pipeline.. Do NOT: Do not skip validating source data at project start.. Do instead: Run a quick data profiling step and present findings to client before design..
