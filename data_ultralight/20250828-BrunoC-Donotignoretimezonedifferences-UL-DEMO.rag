Lesson: Do not ignore timezone differences. Summary: We scheduled daily standups without considering team spread across 3 continents, leading to poor participation.. Context: phase=Execution, client=Global Pharma, industries=Pharma, type=POC. What happened: Team members missed meetings due to inconvenient times.. Root cause: No attention paid to distributed team timezone needs.. (category: Team Coordination) Impact: level=2, Lost collaboration efficiency and slowed decisions.. Do NOT: Do not schedule core ceremonies in one timezone only.. Do instead: Set up rotating meeting times or async standups with tools..
