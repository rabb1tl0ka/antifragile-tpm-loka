Lesson: Do not underestimate compliance reviews. Summary: We thought regulatory review would take 1 week, but it took 1 month. Project stalled until approval came through.. Context: phase=Planning, client=MedTech Inc., industries=Healthcare, type=Pilot. What happened: Regulatory compliance process was longer than expected, blocking deployment.. Root cause: Incorrect assumptions about compliance review timelines.. (category: Compliance) Impact: level=3, Project go-live delayed by 4 weeks.. Do NOT: Do not assume compliance review is trivial.. Do instead: Include realistic compliance timelines in planning and involve legal team early..
