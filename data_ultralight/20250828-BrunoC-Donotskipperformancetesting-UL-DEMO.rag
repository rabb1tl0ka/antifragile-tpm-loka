Lesson: Do not skip performance testing. Summary: We deployed without testing load. Under real usage, the system crashed within 2 days.. Context: phase=Delivery, client=Diagnostics Co., industries=Healthcare, type=MVP. What happened: First production usage caused downtime due to untested scaling issues.. Root cause: No performance or load tests done pre-deployment.. (category: Testing) Impact: level=5, System outage caused loss of client trust.. Do NOT: Do not launch without stress-testing critical flows.. Do instead: Run lightweight load tests on staging with realistic traffic patterns..
